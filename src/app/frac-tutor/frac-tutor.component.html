		<p class="problemStatement">At any given moment, some students need worked examples to model how to perform a task, while others are ready for problem solving practice. How can teachers balance these diverse needs?</p>

		<p class="problemStatement">FracTutor personalizes instruction by giving each student an interleaved blend of problem solving practice and worked examples with self-explanation prompts, based on the student's ability as measured by Bayesian Knowledge Tracing.</p>
