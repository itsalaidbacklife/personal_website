	text="How might we help learners perceive math as beautiful, creative, and gratifying? Proof Crafter is an exploratory game that teaches players the fundamentals of set theory with a novel visual approach to writing proofs."
	text2="Players learn by doing, weaving together arguments as though they were wires and circuitry. The mechanics and sequencing blend together in a smooth tutorial that introduces beginners to the basics of sets and proofs as compelling puzzles."

	text="We conducted several cognitive task analyses in order to understand the skills and knowledge required to create introductory set theory proofs. We began with a theoretical analysis, then did a deeper dive using the think aloud method to empirically analyze the process of writing a proof. We synthesized our results and generalized them into the sequence model shown here on the left."
	text2="We created cognitive instructional goals for the game using by extracting key decision points from our sequence model. This allowed us to frame our understanding of the core skills and conceptual knowledge we wanted our learners to develop."
