		<p class="problemStatement">Cuttle Bot is a web application built in Angular 6 that implements a customized version of the MiniMax algorithm to make its strategic decisions. Players can use the reverse button in the upper-left to undo their move(s) and see how the game plays out when they make different choices. </p>

		<p class="problemStatement">CuttleBot provides mixed initiative, just-in-time feedback to detect when players fail to win or avoid a preventable loss, and nonjudgmentally alerts players of opportunities for better moves. Players learn the ropes through guided discovery; they are free to play their own way and also shown critical details with scaffolding hints.</p>
